IBAM (Itsy Bitsy Album Maker)
http://wiki.omegasdg.com/index.php?title=IBAM

IBAM, also known as the Itsy Bitsy Album Maker, is a small, simple, and embeddable album maker in a single file, written in python.

One day, I found myself looking for an embeddable image album maker. I was surprised to find that many of the projects I discovered were not embeddable, and the ones that were embeddable were also woefully flashy and overcomplicated. So, frustrated, I decided to create my own no-nonsense embeddable album maker. Two hours later, I had a working version of IBAM.

IBAM is a single python script. The configuration variables are inside the script itself, making the software completely self-contained. Once the script is configured, the script and a folder containing images can be uploaded to a webserver that supports python. IBAM is made to be embedded in an iframe rather than viewed directly.

Features:
* The software is self-contained in a single file.
* The script is less than 3kb in size.
* No flashy gimmicks or complicated settings and controls.
* Made to be embedded, unlike other software where embedding is an afterthought.
* An album can be set up in a couple of minutes.
* It's released under the MIT License for maximum freedom.
